# The Ruliad, a Simulation of Worlds

This is a project to partially simulate some of the "worlds in Rulial space" imagined in Stephen Wolfram's "The Ruliad". Each graph represents a simple space, and the structures that can form within it. I give the majority of credit to Stephen Wolfram, and his book, *A New Kind of Science*. We are taking the next step!
